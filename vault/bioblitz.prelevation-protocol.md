## After adding an observation on QField

When you have successfully added your observation on QField, you need to collect the specimen. Here you can find the protocol on how to do it.

## Make sure you are ready
- Make sure you have all the necessary material to collect your sample (little cotton bag given the collection day)
- Make sure you wear gloves (for your security )
