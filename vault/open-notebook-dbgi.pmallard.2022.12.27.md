## Paused

## Done

### updated people list on the www.dbgi.org
  Will need to ask for consent to all the people ans ask for a short bio



## Notes

Didn't remember what was the shortcut to create a daily note. 
It was lost in ... a daily note. So this means that the page should be available elsewhere. 
Maybe think of something related to amoeba pattern https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/e780000d-c784-4945-8e42-35218a3ecf10/ when notes are too big.
This would be a rule to get out notes from the daily notes to the main dendron. You came back to them once so it means they might have some kind of importance and that you should find them in another way then just browsing through your daily notes.

Moved them to [[open-notebook-dbgi.setup]]



## Todo tomorrow
