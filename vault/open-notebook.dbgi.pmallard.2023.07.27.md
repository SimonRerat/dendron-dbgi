Point Edouard

Looking into the noveltries of the qfield app
-dpownload on deggoglzided android --- semms to work fine

- Think about using a defined taxonomy for the field called "sample_name" rather than an excel list per garden.
For example we could use the https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/about/taxonomy-version/ott3.5


When using QGis
we should make sure to use only LTS releases https://qgis.org/en/site/

Addition of 2 tabs "individual metadata" and "environmental metadata" (on top of the main "sample metadata")

- Define which field we want
- We should define which controlled vocabularies are used to fill the newly proposed fields


For e.g. [root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root "In vascular plants, the roots are the organs of a plant that are modified to provide anchorage for the plant and take in water and nutrients into the plant body, which allows  plants to grow taller and faster. They are most often below the surface of the soil, but roots can also be aerial or aerating, that is, growing up above the ground or especially above water.") is could be fetched from the Plant Ontology https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/po/classes/http%253A%252F%252Fpurl.obolibrary.org%252Fobo%252FPO_0009005

Where are the other stages e.g fruiting 

IPEN and related individuals identifiers


Peek into [ENVO](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/envo) and [ECOCORE](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/ecocore)

E.g. humus https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/envo/classes/http%253A%252F%252Fpurl.obolibrary.org%252Fobo%252FENVO_01000000?lang=en
