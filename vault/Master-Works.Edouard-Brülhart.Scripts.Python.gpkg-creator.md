The gpkg-creator script permits to deploy the QGIS plugin we use to create the layers for our collection cessions.

You can install this plugin directly inside the QGIS interface under the name of "DBGI". You can also download it [here](https://github.com/digital-botanical-gardens-initiative/gpkg-creator/releases) and install it manually.

You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/digital-botanical-gardens-initiative/gpkg-creator).
