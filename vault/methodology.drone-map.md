To do the drone map, we firstly put 8 ground markers (Figure 3) all around the botanical garden. Thes control points (Figure 1) are geolocated with a differential GPS that permits to obtain data with an error of less than 3 centimenters (Figure 2). After that, we make the drone fly with an app called "DroneDeploy" that automatically makes fly the drone (Figure 3) and takes pictures of the zone to have a complete mapping.

With these steps, we obtain approximatively 260 high quality pictures with the geolocated ground markers visible on them. We treat them with the agisoft software to obtain the geolocated map (Figure 4). To see the d√©tails of the operations, you can click [there](methodology.agisoft.md).
