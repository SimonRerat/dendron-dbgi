This Bachelor project's takes place in the context of the DBGI. It thrives to introduce a new tool, UUIDs, in the workflows developped by previous bachelor students. Furthermore, this tool could allow to link different samples to an individual instead of to a species. This, in term, could allow to increase the quantity of data attached to a single sample.
