## Starting the day

First lets check the last discussions on the forum https://github.com/digitized-botanical-gardens-initiative/forum/discussions

### Today's Todo 

- [ ] Testing the lyophilisation technic
- [ ] Prelevating some plants in the botanical garden
- [ ] 

### Today Notes & ideas
For the lyophilisation we have tested 15ml tubes, that is a bit small for correctly putting plant parts in it. 50ml would be better. We have tested two different technics to let the vacuum appen in the tube :
- Make little holes in the lid -> Echevaria elegans
- Let a bit open by not completely screw the lid -> Oscularia deltoides, Ephedra helvetica, Leonurus cardiaca, Echevaria elegans

The prelevated plants (4) of today are the same as the ones harvested by Pierre-Marie Allard 04th april that are the followings :
