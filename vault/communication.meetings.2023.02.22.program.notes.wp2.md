### What do we have ?

#### Physical objects

    - living specimens (look trough the window !)
    - dried tissues collections (bring Tubes)
    - extracts (Tubes)
    - fridges
#### Digital objects

    - Species list. We had a quick talk with https://botalista.community/ people.
    - iNat. The DBGI iNat project https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/digital-botanical-gardens-initiative
  We cant use the iNat API (because we have non-research grade observation - cultivated specimens)
    - Directus (http://directus.dbgi.org/) Have a quick tour.
    - MassIVE (several set uploaded e.g. https://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?task=bd2a519b678e4f92aeca6434166ea548, https://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?task=589f0793f15d4b87aebd699900ad468e)
    - Physical samples tracking: none at the moment.

### What do we want ?

#### Physical objects

    - living specimens (look trough the window) - Could this improve ? How ?
    - dried tissues collections (Falcon Tubes) - Could this improve ? How ?
    - extracts (Tubes) - Could this improve ? How ?
    - fridges () - Could this improve ? How ?

#### Digital objects

    - Species list
    - iNat
    - Directus
    - MassIVE
    - Physical samples tracking

Frictionless Software toolkit (https://frictionlessdata.io/)
Bioregistry (https://bioregistry.io/) (Also in WP3)

If we take the directus example, it is hosted on a computer of the COMMONS Lab at UniFr and can only be accessed through the UniFr VPN.
Should we buy / rent another machine to ease external access ?
If so where ? Which specifications ?
