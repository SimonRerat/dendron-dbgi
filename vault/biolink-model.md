Biolink model adopted in frame of the NCATS project.


- A high-level data model for representing biological and biomedical knowledge
- Bridges multiple vocabularies and ontologies
- Agnostic to the graph formalism used to represent knowledge
- The model consists of:

    * [[biolink-model.entities]]
    * [[biolink-model.associations]]
    * [[biolink-model.predicates]]
    * [[biolink-model.properties]]



- Bridges across Neo4j and RDF graphs
- Common dialect for representing knowledge
