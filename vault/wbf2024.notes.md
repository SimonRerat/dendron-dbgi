## RO crates

What is an RO-Crate?
An RO-Crate is a Research Object (or RO) formed of a collection of data (a crate) and a special ro-crate-metadata.json file which describes the collection.

The collection may contain any kind of research data - papers, data files, software, references to other research, and so on. It may be a folder full of files, an abstract grouping of connected references, or a combination of both.

The ro-crate-metadata.json file (also known as the RO-Crate Metadata Document) is a plain text file, readable by humans and machines, that includes metadata for each item within the collection - the authors, license, identifier, provenance, and so on. Any folder can be turned into an RO-Crate by adding an ro-crate-metadata.json file.

Researchers can distribute their work as an RO-Crate to ensure their data travels with its metadata, so that key components are correctly tracked, archived, and attributed.

RO-Crate uses the JSON-LD format, which is based on JSON. The ro-crate-metadata.json file can be written by hand or by using one of the existing tools. Some workflow managers (such as Galaxy) support exporting RO-Crates from their web interface.

Below is an example of an ro-crate-metadata.json file, which describes rainfall data published by an Australian institute under a Creative Commons license:

### Nature first

WHAT IS NATURE FIRST?
The goal of Nature FIRST is to develop predictive, proactive and preventative capabilities for nature conservation stakeholders by combining theoretic premises from the sciences of ecology and environmental forensics with empirical environmental observations (satellite-based & on-site) into a Proof of Principle that is tested and demonstrated in 4 European areas, covering 6 biogeographical regions.

### Crane Radar
With the Crane Radar, you can track Cranes in real time and anticipate where they can be spotted in the next few hours. We hope you enjoy your sightings!

Before every Winter, cranes migrate from cold Scandinavia to warmer areas in France and Spain, and back again before the Spring. Hence, highest changes to see them flying are in October-November and February-March.

Every minute the position(s) of spotted cranes are recalculated. Click on the binocular to get details about the original observation. Zoom in to get more accurate estimates.
