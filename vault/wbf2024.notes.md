## RO crates
https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/

What is an RO-Crate?
An RO-Crate is a Research Object (or RO) formed of a collection of data (a crate) and a special ro-crate-metadata.json file which describes the collection.

The collection may contain any kind of research data - papers, data files, software, references to other research, and so on. It may be a folder full of files, an abstract grouping of connected references, or a combination of both.

The ro-crate-metadata.json file (also known as the RO-Crate Metadata Document) is a plain text file, readable by humans and machines, that includes metadata for each item within the collection - the authors, license, identifier, provenance, and so on. Any folder can be turned into an RO-Crate by adding an ro-crate-metadata.json file.

Researchers can distribute their work as an RO-Crate to ensure their data travels with its metadata, so that key components are correctly tracked, archived, and attributed.

RO-Crate uses the JSON-LD format, which is based on JSON. The ro-crate-metadata.json file can be written by hand or by using one of the existing tools. Some workflow managers (such as Galaxy) support exporting RO-Crates from their web interface.

Below is an example of an ro-crate-metadata.json file, which describes rainfall data published by an Australian institute under a Creative Commons license:

### Nature first

WHAT IS NATURE FIRST?
The goal of Nature FIRST is to develop predictive, proactive and preventative capabilities for nature conservation stakeholders by combining theoretic premises from the sciences of ecology and environmental forensics with empirical environmental observations (satellite-based & on-site) into a Proof of Principle that is tested and demonstrated in 4 European areas, covering 6 biogeographical regions.

### Crane Radar
With the Crane Radar, you can track Cranes in real time and anticipate where they can be spotted in the next few hours. We hope you enjoy your sightings!

Before every Winter, cranes migrate from cold Scandinavia to warmer areas in France and Spain, and back again before the Spring. Hence, highest changes to see them flying are in October-November and February-March.

Every minute the position(s) of spotted cranes are recalculated. Click on the binocular to get details about the original observation. Zoom in to get more accurate estimates.

### BEEHAVE

Honey bees face numerous challenges, including intensive agriculture, diseases, and fluctuations in nectar and pollen availability. The Digital Twin prototype will assess landscape quality to provide practical insights into honey bee performance and honey production.

Honey bees, or Apis mellifera, are vital pollinators and honey producers. Their well-being is closely tied to the landscapes they inhabit, where a continuous supply of nectar and pollen is essential, especially during periods when mass-flowering crops like oilseed rape are unavailable.

The founding charter of the Omic Biodiversity Observation Network (Omic BON) 

Omic BON
The Omic Biodiversity Observation Network (Omic BON) aims to promote coordinated biomolecular observations for global insight and action.

Omic BON is a thematic BON focused on the study of genes, transcripts, proteins, metabolites, and other biomolecules in organisms or environmental materials. Omics enables biodiversity observation at the molecular scale across environments and geographies. Omic BON will complement thematic BONs focused on environments (Marine BON, Freshwater BON, Soil BON), as well as national and regional BONs. Omic BON will additionally closely work with the GEO BON Genetic Composition Working Group.

Omic BON will coordinate its growing partnership to establish a distributed, global biomolecular observatory. Its first round of priorities will be promoting intercalibration of biomolecular observing technologies, the development of globally harmonized practices, standards, and protocols. It provides a forum for international stakeholders to align approaches using existing and new biomolecular technologies. Omic BON also promotes alignment of omic cyberinfrastructures and raises awareness of the societal implications of omics observation (e.g., in the  ethical, legal, and policy domains).

Omic BON will be coordinating effort along five major axes: (1) localized omic observatories, (2) networks of observing platforms, (3) data infrastructures, (4) curated and long-term stores of biosamples, and (5) (meta)data standardization bodies.

PD-2 Unleashing biodiversity's secrets through integrated and scaled genomic science solutions
Addressing the global biodiversity crisis requires an understanding of the diversity of life on Earth, how that diversity functions and interacts, and how biodiversity responds to different environmental pressures. Two key strands of genomic science provide opportunities to develop solutions to address the complex challenges of delivering knowledge to improve our capabilities for effective biomonitoring, biodiversity conservation, and species discovery. DNA barcoding is transforming the speed of completion of the inventory of life on Earth and providing the foundations of global biomonitoring systems. Genome sequencing is transforming understanding at the genetic level and delivering knowledge of how species adapt to environmental change.
This panel discussion aims to bring together experts from these two domains of genomic science in an open forum to (1) introduce the current state-of-the-art to the wider community of stakeholders in biodiversity research and policy; and (2) debate the priorities for addressing challenges and seizing opportunities needed to accelerate and integrate genomic science solutions into practices that enhance the efficacy of management interventions and biomonitoring programmes with state-of-the-art genomic tools.
The organisers of this panel discussion are coordinating the first large-scale pan-European effort to develop and strengthen functioning communities of practice in biodiversity genomics, the Biodiversity Genomics Europe (BGE) Project (https://biodiversitygenomics.eu/). The BGE Project is building European capacity, production, and applications in biodiversity genomics, from field sampling to DNA sequencing followed by data processing and analysis to drive applications in biomonitoring, conservation, and bioeconomy. The panel will comprise two representatives of the BGE Project as well as one representative each from the global umbrella networks the International Barcode of Life (iBOL) and the Earth BioGenome Project (EBP).

SCICOM_15.1 Opening up and preparing scientific publications for the chatGPT-age
Our scientific understanding of biodiversity is traditionally communicated through scientific publications and reports in a format geared towards the human reader. The sheer number of publications produced annually, and a backlog of hundreds of millions of pages make it impossible to keep up with this knowledge, even for a restricted topic. Also the discovery of new relevant publications is challenging, albeit in a digital world this could be instantaneous. This has an impact from reviewing the state and changes in biodiversity and its causes to measuring and understanding the impact of recommendations. It contributes to a North-South divide of access to this information, and it is not suited to make use of  fledgling artificial intelligence applications to mine and discover the wealth embedded in this data.
Recent developments in converting scientific publications or publishing them from the beginning in machine-actionable, semantic blocks of text are leading a way forwards for example to access data about species or discover biotic interactions. Furthermore, since these blocks of text or data are made findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR data) through the Biodiversity Literature Repository (BLR) and the biodiversityPMC, this opens scientific publications to everybody, as well as to advanced data analytic and artificial  tools. It also enables customizing the annotations in publications for domain specific purposes, for example to support reporting in IPBES.
In this session an overview will be provided of how to access biodiversity data through the biodiversityPMC and BLR, how publications can be processed after publishing or published in machine actionable ways to import into biodiversityPMC and BLR, and how the data is being used. Part of the session will include representative invited lectures the other part will be used for a discussion with potential stakeholders.
