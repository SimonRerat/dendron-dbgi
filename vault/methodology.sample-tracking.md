We need to think about the problematic of sample tracking trough vial/eppendorf and other containers which will be used in our labas and others.
Ideally a lightweight system that wouldn't imply the deployment of a heavy LIMS.

This papers seems to offer some nice solutions

## Nocodb

Looking into nocodb (https://www.nocodb.com/) to handle the sample tracking.

# QR code 


Printing QR code redirecting to the individual entry for each DBGI samples is done.

Now the idea would be to fuind a convenient way to scan poor quality QR codes and multiples QR codes at once.
I thought that such tool would be easy to find (especially for the multipl QR code scanner ) but it is not the case.

Some direction to explore
