Firstly, we have cleaned the plant list of the Fribourg botanical garden to obtain a clear document with all unique species with their informations and locations in the garden. In the same time we have, with the help of the "Open Tree of Life" taxonomy, created a complete taxonomy of all plants. We try now to add a wikipedia and OTL link for any branch of the taxonomy, to have basic informations of them. These steps are not mandatory but permit to begin with good bases for the future of the project.

Secondly, the 96 well plate will be partly filled with the same specimen, extracted with different liquid chromatography methods to seclect the best extraction way. Another fraction of the plate will host different parts of the same plant to determine the chemistry differences between them. For instance, it is not clear if we will analyse these different parts separately or alltogether in the same well. If some well are still available, they will be filled with some species, selected randomly or not, in the Fribourg botanical garden.

Finally, the results obtained will be analysed to select the best extraction method and to determine the way to analyse different parts of the same specimen. With these observations, an extraction and analysis protocol will be built to simplify, automatize and coordinate the future data acquisition. These results will be added to the taxonomy, to begin the large scale metabolomics database.

## Extraction methods

For instance, the extraction method is not fixed. We will try some and determine the chosen one later as explained above. The idea is at least to try one with liquid nitrogen to obtain the maximum of chemicals and another one with dryed plants in silica gel to have a facilitated method to collect the plants wolrdwide without the problem of bringing liquid nitrogen in remote areas. The first one with liquid nitrogen seems to be better to capt the chemicals before their degradation (oxydation for example) or disappearence (volatiles) and provide the best quality chemicals detection ([[biblio.devos_2007]]). But for many applications, it is impossible to use liquid nitrogen in the field, in the industry or to conserve these compounds until they get used by privates. That is why a method with dryed plants would be more convenient for the acquisition and the further potential utilisation in the industry or in the private context, thus these volatiles or unstable compounds are not so important to find.

### Liquid nitrogen extraction

The acidified aqueous methanol with 75% methanol and 0.1% formic acid seems to be the most efficient solvent for extraction of a large range of compounds, especially for secondary metabolites. The plant is directly frozen by liquid nitrogen, some solvant is added to obtain a ratio solvent/sample of 3 and the solution is sonicated 15 minutes. The column used for the liquid chromatography is a C<sub>18</sub>-reversed phase microbore with a small particle size, with a 45 minutes low continuous acetonitrile gradient followed by 15 minutes of washing and stabilization of the gradient. For big analyses higher gradient with less time could be possible, with a loss of resolution. All the steps are precisely described in [[biblio.devos_2007]]. 

### Dryed plants extraction
For the dried technic, 30mg dried powder seems to be a good weight for the sample. For the extraction, the same technic as liquid nitrogen seems to be good. In ([[biblio.pan_2020]]) however, only aqueous methanol at 75% concentration is used, with an utrasonic extraction of 1 hour un a water bath to extract alkaloids. After a 10 minutes centrifugation at 14'000 rpm, the supernatant is diluted 10 folds with 75% aqueous methanol. These solutions are stored at 4°C before analysis ([[biblio.pan_2020]]). Another technic is available for dryed plant extract with other reagants in [[biblio.pan_2018]].

To dry plants, the method we will use is probably silica gel in a ziplock bag. It permits to have a great tissues conservation and is practical in the field. Moreover, it can be reused multiple time by heating the silica gel at 120°C during 2 hours ([[biblio.shibata_2013]]).
