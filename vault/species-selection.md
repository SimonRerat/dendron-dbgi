Theofania Patsiou (Parisod group at UniFr is interested in profiling Saxifragaceae) and we have an ongoing project on metabolomics of 200 Saxifraga florulenta.
Maybe a family to think about

# Papaver 

See https://www.unifr.ch/jardin-botanique/fr/recherche/projets.html
Most likely will not be developed enough in March/May
