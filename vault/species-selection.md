# Species list

For an overview of species present in the UniFr botanical garden you can have a look at this website http://www.dbgi.org/dendron-jbuf/.

Noting here. For the previous website a specific option needs to be set up for dendron publishing. Thnaks to Kevin @Dendron for this one.
See line 43 here https://github.com/digital-botanical-gardens-initiative/dendron-jbuf/blob/ff84020e6fc43aca3e7aa7302a2f72b661f756e2/.github/workflows/publish.yml#L43




# Species selection

Possible candidates for species to select for the pilot.

## Saxifragaceae

Theofania Patsiou (Parisod group at UniFr is interested in profiling Saxifragaceae) and we have an ongoing project on metabolomics of 200 Saxifraga florulenta.
Maybe a family to think about

## Papaver 

See https://www.unifr.ch/jardin-botanique/fr/recherche/projets.html
Most likely will not be developed enough in March/May
