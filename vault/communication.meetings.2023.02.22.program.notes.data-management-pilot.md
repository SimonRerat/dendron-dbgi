Data Management Pilot

Show briefly 

- How we fetch data from iNat ?
- How is this managed in the PG ?
- How is it accessible through Directus ?

Why did we choose Directus (pros and cons) 

 - cons : 
  - served form a machine accessible only behind the UniFR VPN (not Directus specific but should be discussed as it will impact other tools)
