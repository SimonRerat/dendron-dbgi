## Notes
Unfortunately, today was a very tedious day. I spent almost the whole day trying to find a solution for the oversized pictures that my mobile phone takes. They are far too big with my iPhone and, unfortunately, my iPhone doesn't work very well with the QField. That was very annoying. Well there is no way to set my mobile phone to take smaller pictures. So it's going to take a lot of work to resize them afterwards and also there's a lot of data and that's why the synchronisation always takes so long for me because the data is so huge.

## Todo tomorrow
