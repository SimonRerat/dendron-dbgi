# This is Marco's daily open-notebook.

Today is 2024.01.15


## Notes
### Today's call with Luca
We don't have negatives. --> could use the weight of the loss for the negatives 

even having 2 models is not a big problem. we could have a convolution that parses those features

we need : 
- features for molecules : 
- features for species

It looks like CHEM-BERT works better than MAP4 for the features.

## Todo today

## Doing


## Done
* 


## Todo tomorrow
* insert nodes for each term in NCBI taxon. 
* Insert NCBi taxon to the graph that I created. This will allow to increase the information for the species with an NCBi id and the other will just have the wikidata topology.
