# Botanical Gardens, collection of specimens & legal aspects 

## Botanical Gardens


- Anne-Laure, Donat, Nadir, Blaise, Gregor 

### What do we have ?

For now UniFr / UniNe

### What do we want ?

Other Botanical gardens in CH ? International ?
Private Partner Orchids GreeenHouse (EMI/DBGI ?)


## Litterature information collection 

This part should eventually be linked with the anticipated LOTUS project.
However discussing it we could think about the best way to integrate [Taxonomic treatments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomic_treatment) in the DBGI-KG from the very beginning of the project and not afterwards



From Donat's part
> Thanks for the invitation. I had a look at the program and wonder whether you want to have a few slides about the linking of metabolomes to specimens to literature, essentially what you asked for in the BiCIKL TNA proposal.
> On our side we are interested to process Phytochemistry so you could then create the links and we could work with Patrick Ruch to see how we could annotate chemical substances in SIBiLS once we have the Phytochemistry articles in SIBiLS

They are two aspects here.
- how do we track _specimens_ and not only species ?
- how do we exploit previous knowledge

Both are very important, but the first one is of utmost importance in the DBGI and EMI.
