# Complete setup of the ubuntu server step-by-step
1) Download Ubuntu desktop (in this situation Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Jammy jelly) iso
2) Flash the iso with balena etcher on a USB key. Then plug the USB on the machine where we want to install Ubuntu. Access the bios and boot from the USB key.
3) Configure the ubuntu desktop: choose the keyboard layout you want (in this case switzerland -> switzerland-French, no dead keays), skip the wireless step, choose minimal installation and check "install third-party software for graphics and Wi-Fi hardware and additional media formats". Then choose Erase disk and install ubuntu. Then choose a region (here Zurich) and a username and password. Ubuntu will install and reboot. When is asks, unplug the USB key and press enter. ubuntu is now installed.
