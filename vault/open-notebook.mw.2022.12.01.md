# This is MaÃ«lle's DBGI daily open-notebook.

Today is 2022.12.01


## TODO

- [x] dbgi_id without regex
- [x] url on directus
- [ ] show images

### If everything done before end of day
- [ ] go on with the tutorial

## CODE

### url on directus
Added directus-extension-display-link extension 

```bash
npm install directus-extension-display-link
```

## NOTE
Had problems with conda environment and spent a lot of time resolving them

Fetching the emi_external_id without regex in format_module.py now seems to work!
=> problem was du to the environment

## TODO NEXT
