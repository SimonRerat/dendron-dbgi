## Doing

We are having some issues (stucked SPARQL queries, max 1 concurrent query, etc.) with the ENPKG GraphDB instance. 
https://enpkg.commons-lab.org/graphdb/

As discussed with Marco Pagni we should look into alternatives.
MP and Seb are looking into the following options:

- RDF4J/Virtuoso
- qendpoint https://the-qa-company.com/products/qEndpoint

We should discuss these with Tarcisio and Ana.
