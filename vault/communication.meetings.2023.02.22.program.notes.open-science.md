    - Publication of the ChordB ORD proposal ?

Would allow to have a first research outcome published. 
    How should we proceed regarding the budget ? How heavy should be the reformating ? 

- Zulip, Github Discussions

Have a slide explaining the relation of :

- email
- Zulip
- Dendron
- Github Discussions
- Github issues

All these means are encouraged but should not be a brake to implication and development
