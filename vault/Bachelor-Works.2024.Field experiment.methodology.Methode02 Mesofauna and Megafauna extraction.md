## Inital Concept
Compare the mesofauna of the soil between the conventional and the biodynamic agriculture. We decide to use the berlese extractor to collecte the mesofauna. We want to extract the metabolite of the entire sample without sorting the invertebrate and use this to rate the chimiodiversity of the soil. The megafauna (earthworm, centipede, spiders...) is sorted out before the berlese extraction and analyzed as individual extracts. 

## Methodology 
### Collect
A place is randomly chose in the side row of the 5m x 20m plot. To limit the crop damage, we took the soil sample right under the 20cm x 20cm cut for the methode 1. A bloc of soil of 10cm x 10cm and 5cm deep is collected and store in a zip-lock prelabelled with an unique code. The soil blocks are store in a shaded area until the end of the collection process. They are then store in the 4Â°C fridge to await the extraction.
