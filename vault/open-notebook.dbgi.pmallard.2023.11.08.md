### Meeting DBGI Wednesday 08 November 2023


Luca present EMIKG

- difference between modular code and monolithic code


One of the steps we certainly need to work on is the alignment of all EMI-related projects.
We need to define the set of APIs that need to be available in the EMI backend, to better focus our efforts and aim to have a well-defined product to deliver.

I have prepared a Google Docs document that we may use to jot down notes.
Please add objects to the object section using the "Header 2", and methods to each object using "Header 3".
Feel free to include https://draw.io/ schemas to clarify potentially difficult points.

Please proceed with edits using the 'suggestion' mode, to make clear the author of each contribution and be able to chat before integrating any edit.
