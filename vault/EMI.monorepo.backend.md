# Monorepo : Backend
Here we describe the basic structure of the backend of the [EMI monorepo](https://github.com/earth-metabolome-initiative/emi-monorepo/tree/web).

## `constraint_checkers`
This folder contains the metaprogramming code to check the correctness of the database, and then to generate the rust files depending on the constraints.
