Meeting (09/07/2024) with James from OneZoom, Pierre-Marie, Disha and Emmanuel

1. There are currently 2 mio species on OneZoom. They want to expand on gneomic data, biomass, chemodiv etc. The code is on github, so it is free to be re-used in whatever way we want.
2. How many species to be presented on the OneZoom tree? We have ~37,000 from lotus and ~1690 from enpkg for which we have chemodiv records.
3. What is our expectation? We want to publicize the citizen science agora project thrugh OneZoom and encourage them to collect samples and help us expand knowledge on chemodiv. We also want to provide generic information on chemodiversity to people. Both  require different approaches for developing the chemodiv facet on OneZoom. Need to brainstorm on that. 
4. Who will take the responsibility of updating the data objects related to chemodiv? What is the long-term sustainability plan?
5. If the data objects are changed, then there will breaks in the information flow and OneZoom will not point to the right links. 
6. OneZoom updates their tree once an year, so if the records for chemodiv change, then they will not be immediately reflected on the tree.
7. Budget for the inegration of chemodiv data on OneZoom can be decided only once we have decided on the user journey and features to integrate. Salary for the developer in the budget?
8. OneZoom's budget comes from sponsorships, philanthropic contributions, charity (UK charity commission). So, integration within AGORA project is lucrative for them.
9. Server for hosting OneZoom is pretty basic and no fancy configuration. It depends on the traffic to the website.
10. We decided on including tabs for wikidata ids and inat ids for all species on OneZoom. Approsh- open an issue on github.
11. If we want just a portion/selected branches on the tree and not the full tree, then we can make our own and display it. Work on the forked branch of the github code.
12. Active plan of the user-journey here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fCQZsagGyJXOhEsYIBtdMmLRSoyLvyJ2/view?usp=sharing
