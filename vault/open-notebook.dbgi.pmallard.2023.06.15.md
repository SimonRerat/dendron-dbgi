## Doing

### Meeting on the EMI semantic model

Ana, Tarcisio and Luca

- Their is a graphical schema (based on Arnaud's scheme for ENPKG here)
https://app.diagrams.net/#G1g1nAgeIZEwBL63Adcwb1dDVOOO2rE2H1

https://github.com/digital-botanical-gardens-initiative/earth_metabolome_ontology


- Decided to establish the licence of the semantic model to CC0
- Add ORCID as contributors
- protégé https://protege.stanford.edu/ 
- Tarcisio reserved prefixes dbgi / emi at prefix.cc and purl.


Luca mentionned that we should think beforehand on the problems that could arise from having highly connected nodes (stars) such as a node ISDB linked to from all annotations with a has_ISDB_annotation edge. 


We need to think about a metamodel.

We need to think about constraints (e.g. IK should have and associated IK2D)
