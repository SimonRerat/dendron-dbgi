# This is Edouard's DBGI daily open-notebook.

Today is 2023.01.03

# To do

- Relabel the falcon with the bigger labels

- Try to host correctly the dbgi maps with geoserver

- Prepare the inserts for the mass spec analysis

- Optimize the communication between QGIS and iNaturalist

# done

Today I tried to display the map on the website by creating Ã  .js file and by adding some code in it (mapdisplay.js). However, for instance it doesn't work. I'll try later to make it work, but it seems better than what I've already done the 24th of december.
