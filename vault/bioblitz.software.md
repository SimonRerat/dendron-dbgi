## Before the event

It's better to install and setup the field collection application before the event. This application is available on IOS and Android devices.

### Download QField for QGIS on the appstore/playstore
- IOS: [QField for QGIS IOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/qfield-for-qgis/id1531726814)
- Android: [QField for QGIS Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.opengis.qfield&pli=1)

Alternatively, on Androids, you can download the APK file from [https://github.com/opengisch/QField/releases](https://github.com/opengisch/QField/releases)

**Make sure to accept these following permissions to make QField work properly: "Camera", "Pictures and videos" and "Location"**

### Create an account on the server

Go to [this adress](https://emi-collection.unifr.ch/accounts/signup/) and create an account. If you have the error below, don't worry, your account has been successfully created.

 Send me an email (edouard.bruelhart@unifr.ch) with:
 - The account username you freshly created
 - Your complete name
 - Your ORCID identifier
 
**This step is useful to give you write access to the project and to link the samples you collect to you.**

### Open the bioblitz project in QField
