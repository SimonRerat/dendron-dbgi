We use [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/home) to track the selected specimens in the DBGI.

See [[Bachelor-Work-2022.methodology.inaturalist.md]] for some details worked on during Edouard's bachelor.


We had issues to fetch back all observation of a project through [pyinaturalist](https://github.com/pyinat/pyinaturalist), notably because of obscured geolocalisation for some protected species.
This is now solved, see https://github.com/pyinat/pyinaturalist/issues/403.
