We use [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/home) to track the selected specimens in the DBGI.

See [[Bachelor-Work-2022.methodology.inaturalist.md]] for some details worked on during Edouard's bachelor.


We had issues to fetch back all observation of a project through [pyinaturalist](https://github.com/pyinat/pyinaturalist), notably because of obscured geolocalisation for some protected species.
This is now solved, see https://github.com/pyinat/pyinaturalist/issues/403.



## App creation

After meeting the requirements for an app creation demand we asked for one here https://www.inaturalist.org/oauth/applications
This is required if we want to explore the possibilities of automated upload through https://pyinaturalist.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html#create-and-update-observations
