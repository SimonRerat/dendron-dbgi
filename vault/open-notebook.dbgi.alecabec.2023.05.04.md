**DBGI Workflow** : from the creation of an DBGI_ID to the mass spectrometry analysis 

In order to use the workflow you will need to have the following account / application : directus, Avery, Qfield, Inaturalist, GNPS 

1. **Creation of the DBGI_ID** 
  
  a. Creation of an account on directus  
  
  b. Implementation of the sample list (http://www.dbgi.org/dendron-dbgi/notes/l5hk8footuy2893u4zi6yvs/) 
  
  c. Print label 

  You will need to print two kinds of labels, one for the plant samples and the other for the plant extract. (template are available here : )
  
  d. Labelling falcon tube + protect with scotch tape 

2. **Plant's collect** 
   
  a. Before collecting : provide for sufficient collection tubes with DBGI-SPL-ID 
  
  b. Qfield software (follow the protocol section 'utilisation of Qfield'  http://www.dbgi.org/dendron-dbgi/notes/h33m4gr8eny7li4yhlxotdb) during collection 
  
  c. Transfert the data collected to iNaturalist (http://www.dbgi.org/dendron-dbgi/notes/ssi87anaiik1o7joqf7mvdp/)
  
3. **Extraction** (extraction section : http://www.dbgi.org/dendron-dbgi/notes/mpboa8wpvhpygf5fw4o9v11/)
 
100 µL in one vial for analysis LC-MS/MS + one vial with ~XX µL in the freezer 


4. **LC-MS analysis**
  
  a. Preparation of the samples list 

  b. Analysis 

5. **Datatreatment**
