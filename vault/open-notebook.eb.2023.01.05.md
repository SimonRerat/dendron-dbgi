# This is Edouard's DBGI daily open-notebook.

Today is 2023.01.05

# To do

- Relabel the falcon with the bigger labels

- Try to host correctly the dbgi maps with geoserver (actually delayed)

- Prepare the inserts for the mass spec analysis

- Optimize the communication between QGIS and iNaturalist

- If time, automatize the process of printing label, by writing a code that automatically selects 189 (number of labels on one page) free dbgi codes on the directus database, and add them to an excel sheet, ready to print.

# Perspectives

# notes

batch edition seems possible. I began to create a R code that will change the device coordinates by the coordinates indicated in QField for the placed point. I'll try it harder tomorrow.
