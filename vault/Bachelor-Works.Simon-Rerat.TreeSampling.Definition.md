As this work will mainly revolve around trees, starting by giving a clear definition of what a tree is would would help make things clearer, and avoid unnecessary sampling.

So what is a tree ?

Childish at first glance, this simple question is all the more relevant as their appears to be no precise, universally agreed definition, wether be it in botany or in the common language (Francis Hallé, Aux origines des plantes. Des plantes anciennes à la botanique du XXIe siècle, Fayard, 2008, p. 36.). More than 250 defintions coexist (Lund, Gyde. (2015). Definitions of 'tree' and 'shrub'. 10.13140/RG.2.1.4103.9848. ) at the moment.
Phylogeny leaves us totally clueless as tree-like growth forms appeared indepentently many time through life's long history. Indeed, lycopods, ferns, sphenopsids, gymnosperms and many time in angiosperms (palms, dragon tree, "normal trees") (John Raven, Peter Crane,Trees, Current Biology,Volume 17, Issue 9, 2007,Pages R303-R304,ISSN 0960-9822,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2007.01.041.(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982207008792)).



According to Raunkier a tree is a lignified plant of more than 7-8m high, with a unique trunk, usually nude at the base, with branches forming a crown. => what determined the logo on the panels ?

To synthetize the different definitions into the "essence" of a tree: Perennial woody plant growing to a certain height, with an unique self-sustaining trunk, nude at its base, with branches at some distance from the ground forming a crown. => there are a quite copious amount of exceptions, or species that dont fit in, this is for an ideal tree only

As I relied mostly on the panels to make my sample. I will use the definition they used => i.e. probably the Raunkier ones
