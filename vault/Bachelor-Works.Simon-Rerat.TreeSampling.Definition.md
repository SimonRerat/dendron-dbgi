Definition:
Defining what a tree is might seem childish at first glance. However, this simple question is all the more relevant as many definitions exist (Lund, 2015), but none has been universally agreed upon in the world of botany (Hallé, 2008).

Phylogeny leaves us somewhat clueless to what a tree is as tree-like growth forms appeared indepentently many time through Life's long history. Indeed, lycopods, ferns, sphenopsids, gymnosperms and many time in angiosperms (palms, dragon tree, "normal trees") (John, Peter, 2007). The first modern tree, Archaeopteris appears during the Devonian period forming large forests. It is not the only arborescent plant living through the Carboniferous as the family Lepidondendron did form massiv forests (Fairon-Demaret, 1986). Still observable to this day, the tree ferns are also a good exemple of arborescent growth forms.

The JBUF seems to be using the 8 basic families of the Raunkier system (or even a horticol definition, cf. mail Alain Mueller) in order to separate the different forms of plants. (insert image of the raunkier system). In our case, all the trees should fall into the category of the phanerophytes. However, this category doesn't allow to differentiate between bush, shrubs, and trees. This, in itself is a big enough problem. The Raunkier system is based on the location of the plant's growth-point during seasons providing adverse conditions, such as cold, and dry seasons. Thus excluding plants living in environment presenting only good seasons, i.e. tropical plants.
As the EMI is a project of international scope, the Raunkier system doesn't seem to provide a relevant definition.
Furthermore, it defines the lignification of the trunk as a necessary criteria for being a tree and the presence of a single trunk.
This definition does 

There seems to be a sort of universal inner idea of what a tree is. When you ask people if such or such plant is a tree the answer can vary

In this work I will use the definition of Francis Hallé as it doesn't goes against the intuitive that each person has of what a tree is, independently of time and space.
It reads as follow: 
«Un arbre est une plante habituellement pérenne possédant un ou plusieurs tronc à croissance verticale. Son anatomie rend le tronc autoportant et lui permet d'élever au-dessus des plantes voisines, concurrentes pour la lumière, une cime, ou couronne qui selon les espèces peut avoir trois constitutions différentes: 
    De grandes feuilles si l'arbre n'a pas de branches;
    Des branches qui assurent la photosynthèse si les feuilles sont trop petite pour assurer cette fonction ou absentes;
    Des branches feuillées dans le cas général.
Enfin, l’arbre est un «grand» végétal. Sa hauteur, le diamètre de son tronc, sa longévité sont évalués au regard des dimensions et de la durée de vie de l’être humain.»

Which could be roughly translated as :
«A tree is a generally perennial plant possessing one or more trunk growing vertically. Its anatomy makes the trunk self-supporting, allowing to rise above its neighbours, competitors for light,a summit, or crown, which, can have tree different constitutions depending on the species:
        Large leaves if the tree deosn't have any branch;
        Branches ensuring photosynthesis if the leaves ar to small to ensure this function, or absent;
        Leafed branches in most cases.
Finally, a tree is a «large» plant. Its height, the diameter of its trunk, its lifespan are evaluated taking human beings as a reference.» 

To summarize, a large plant growing a trunk (Hallé, 2008)

How I did it:
The BotaBota followed the Raunkier classification. Sort of lacks precision and doesn't differentiate between shrubs/arbusts/trees
However, in a spirit of universality, Hallé's definition seems more suitable
