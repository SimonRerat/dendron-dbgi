# This is PMA's DBGI daily open-notebook.

Today is 2023.02.23

## Todo today

### Have a look at the DBGI discussion forum
    - https://github.com/orgs/digital-botanical-gardens-initiative/discussions
###
###

## Doing


### Point Maelle

We talked about https://datashader.org/
And using vaex
plotly resampler
Try to run a local version of the https://github.com/mwang87/GNPS_LCMSDashboard


## Establish a Dashboard for Human Data Interaction in the DBGI

(refer to ChordB proposal for details)

1. establish a Dashboard to view "LOTUS type data"

- molecular structures
  - molecular structure metadata 
  - molecular structure taxonomies
- biological organisms
  - biological organisms structure metadata 
  - biological organisms structure taxonomies

This Dashboard can feed on static tabular files

2. establish a Dashboard to view "DBGI type data"

"DBGI type data" = "LOTUS type data" + mass spectrometry data

- LCMS profiles
- spectrums

cf. GNPS LCMS Dashboard

This Dashboard can feed on static tabular files + Mass spec files

3. Improve these Dashboard so they can feed on KG

- SPARQL queries 


## Paused

## Done

## Notes

- Red arrow system for specimens labelling

Thinking off the specimens identifications issues discussed in the last DBGI meeting see [[communication.meetings.2023.02.22.program.notes.botanical-garden]]

Here is a possible solution.
Clearly not perfect but maybe a basis to be improved upon.

Basically the idea would be to have a physical marker (example a red arrow in the pictures attached) pointing toward the sampled specimen.
The picture should be take when sampling the specimen with a large angle (in oprder to cover the spatical resolution error of the smartphone)

A unique id should also be attributed to a specimen. This ID could be labelled on the red arrow and also photographed, just as for the samples id.

Improvements: 

- a laser pointing system that would display both the arrow and the code on the ground.
- a portable printer to have the label directly printed when doing the collection.

Also we thought that having more than the minimal 5 pictures could be important. For ex in the picture below we see that they can be a good mean to describe even broadly the environment of the plant (e.g neighboring species, soil aspect etc)
