# This is PMA's DBGI daily open-notebook.

###

## Doing


### Point Maelle

We talked about https://datashader.org/
And using vaex
plotly resampler
Try to run a local version of the https://github.com/mwang87/GNPS_LCMSDashboard


## Establish a Dashboard for Human Data Interaction in the DBGI

(refer to ChordB proposal for details)

1. establish a Dashboard to view "LOTUS type data"

- molecular structures
  - molecular structure metadata 
  - molecular structure taxonomies
- biological organisms
  - biological organisms structure metadata 
  - biological organisms structure taxonomies

This Dashboard can feed on static tabular files

2. establish a Dashboard to view "DBGI type data"

"DBGI type data" = "LOTUS type data" + mass spectrometry data

- LCMS profiles
- spectrums

cf. GNPS LCMS Dashboard

This Dashboard can feed on static tabular files + Mass spec files

3. Improve these Dashboard so they can feed on KG

- SPARQL queries
