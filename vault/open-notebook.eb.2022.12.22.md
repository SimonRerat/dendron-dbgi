# This is Edouard's DBGI daily open-notebook.

Today is 2022.12.22

# To do

- Make a github repository to version the used csv. It will be the "mannually changeable" part of the project, opposed to directus that is the automated part of the project.

- Relabel the falcon with the bigger labels

- Try to host correctly the dbgi map with geoserver

- Prepare the inserts for the mass spec analysis

- Optimize the communication between QGIS and iNaturalist

# done

# Perspectives

# notes

Today I succeeeded to import the JBN drone map. The solution is to clip the raster in multiple parts to not have one big file but mutliple smaller files. With that, the import is made without any problem. It should be a solution when making large areas.
