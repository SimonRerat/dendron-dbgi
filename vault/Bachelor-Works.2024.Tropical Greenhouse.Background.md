# Digital Botanical Garden Initiative
The digital botanical garden Initiative (DBGI) is a pilot project whose aim is to extract, catalogue, analyze and create a digital library of metabolomic data from plants found in botanical gardens. 

Botanical gardens, although human-made, are hotspots of biodiversity and the ideal place to test harvesting, extraction and analysis methods. They display a considerable number of plants (over 5,000 in Fribourg) in a small, accessible area. Botanical gardens provide an initial approach and the methods needed to eventually collect different organisms from wild ecosystems (see Earth Metabolome Initiative). Their biodiversity also makes it possible to set up a library of chemical extracts, enabling the development of the IT tools needed to analyze these data.
