# Harvesting


# Extraction 
All plant extracts are freeze-dried and store in a container. 

The first step is to weigh out 50 micrograms of each extract and place it in an eppendorf 2ml with rounded bottom. We accepted an 5% of the weight as an error (±2.5 micrograms). Then add thee metal beads (4mm) inside the tube which will be used to crush the extracts.

The sample are then passed in the Retsch machine (shaker) for 2.5 minutes at 25Hz. In this process, the plants are ground to a fine powder. 

Once the plants have been ground, the tubes are carefully reopened and 1.7 ml of the extraction solution is pipetted into each tube. The extraction solution mix is composed of 80% methanol, 20% distilled water and 0.1% formic acid. The tubes are then returned to the Restch machine to be shaken again for 2.5 minutes at 25Hz.The tubes are then centrifuged for 2 minutes at 13'000RPM to separate the supernatant from the plant deposits. 

Finally, the supernatant is collected and pipetted into a vials tube with hermetically sealed caps. Approximately 1.4 ml of supernatant can be recovered. These tubes are then stored in a labelled container at -80°C

# Sample Tracking 
Because of the large number of samples, it is important to have reliable sample tracking. As soon as the samples are collected, each plant is assigned a unique code. This code will follow the plant through each stage of extraction and analysis. Each tube is labelled at each stage with the unique code of the corresponding plant and a marker for the current stage. By consulting the database, we can quickly find out which plant has already been extracted, how many times it has been extracted, and in which container the various tubes are stored. The whole process is automated, and the database automatically updated.
