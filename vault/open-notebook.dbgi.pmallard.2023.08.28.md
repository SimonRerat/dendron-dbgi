## Doing

## Paused

## Done

### Quick chat with Donat

- talked about the possibility of a DBGI hackaton : from collection to SPARQL query
The problem is that we need to lyophilize/MS in between
This would need to be splitted in maybe two half a week hackatons.

Fo the first part, Donat proposed that we could collect in the Vinesh vineyards https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/vinesch where they allready sampled a lot.

- PIDs :
Mention of DiSSCO developping their PID (not mature for now) https://know.dissco.eu/handle/item/318

- Hortus botanicus in Neuchatel this Wednesday 

- thibnk of ways to push DBGI samples to GBIF, eventough they are not "Research grade" obervations on www.inaturalist.org
Donat will also investigate into this

Donat mentionned we should be able to publish to GBIF without beeing an organization.
This isn't that clear from this page https://www.gbif.org/become-a-publisher
Notably :

> Note: At present, GBIF and its Participants only publish data from organizations—that is, institutions, networks and societies—rather than individuals. Options for individuals who wish to publish data include:
> 
> - working through their affiliated organizations to seek endorsement as a publisher
> - publishing data papers through a journal publisher with GBIF-ready software and/or hosting services
> - sharing records through one of the many citizen science platforms that publish records to GBIF

We have to dig this

- Set a meeting for this Friday with Patrick and Adriano on progress of the BiCICKL TNA
