## Paused

### Quick chat with Donat

- talked about the possibility of a DBGI hackaton : from collection to SPARQL query
The problem is that we need to lyophilize/MS in between
This would need to be splitted in maybe two half a week hackatons.

Fo the first part, Donat proposed that we could collect in the Vinesh vineyards https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/vinesch where they allready sampled a lot.

- PIDs :
Mention of DiSSCO developping their PID (not mature for now) https://know.dissco.eu/handle/item/318

- Hortus botanicus in Neuchatel this Wednesday 

- thibnk of ways to push DBGI samples to GBIF, eventough they are not "Research grade" obervations on www.inaturalist.org
Donat will also investigate into this
