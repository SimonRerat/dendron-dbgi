The aim of the DBGI is to characterize the chemodiversity of the all botanical gardens of Switzerland. This ambitious objective requires us to evaluate and test the entire workflow and methodology. For this, the initiators of the DBGI started gathering preliminary data from two botanical collections: the Jardin Botanique de l’Université de Fribourg (JBUF) and the Jardin Botanique de Neuchâtel (JBN). This choice was made for practical reasons (these are the respective working places of the DBGI initiators) but also because these two gardens each offer their unique characteristics. On one hand the JBUF presents over 5000 species systematically organized to reflect the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) system. The JBUF researchers are specialized in conservation biology. On the other hand, the JBN presents over 2000 species organized in 8 sub-gardens. The JBN has a focus on ethnomedicinal plants. Below, we will briefly outline the research workflow envisioned for the DBGI. The main steps have been schematized in Figure 3). The overall workflow can be divided into two main parts: one dealing with physical objects (upper part of Figure 3) and a second one dealing with data and metadata acquired from these objects (lower part of Figure 3).
