## Abstract

database used would require optimization with addition of reference spectra for the organism and its close relatives (e.g., B. thailandensis). B. pseudomallei, although differ-ent from other Burkholderia spp. in its pathogenicity and epidemiology, is not easily discriminated from B. thailand-ensis or B. cepacia complex by using phenotypic tests (10). In summary, infection with B. pseudomallei should be considered in patients with pneumonia after travel to the Baja Peninsula in Mexico, and especially after an extreme weather event. Because of risk for transmission to laborato-ry workers and the potential for B. pseudomallei to be used for bioterrorism, clinical laboratories should perform only limited work up of suspected isolates before referring them to a public health laboratory for definitive identification.
