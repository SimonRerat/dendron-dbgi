### What do we have ?

- ENPKG 

https://enpkg.commons-lab.org/graphdb/
https://enpkg.commons-lab.org/

The idea for now is to fork the ENPKG repos on the DBGI organisation.
We will build on these, at least for the MS > RDF part. 



### What do we want ?

- DBGI-KG
- EMI-KG

- Wikibase. Is this an option ? 
How complicated ? Does someone has experience in setting these up ?
