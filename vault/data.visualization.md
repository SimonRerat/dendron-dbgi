# Ressources

A great dashboard here https://microbeatlas.org/ 
(Thanks Ola for the heads up!)

In the ChordB proposal we talked about (but didn't elaborate on) :

- A web interface displaying the results of the KG queries (see above for details) and adopting the Vega grammar (https://vega.github.io/vega/) will be established to allow users to visually explore the DBGI data.
- Dash (https://dash.gallery/Portal/) python framework will also be evaluated for interactive displays.
