## Abstract

Hydroxylation reactions are catalysed by a few major subclasses of enzymes which are ubiquitously distributed in nature. Dioxygenases generally occur as soluble enzymes where they catalyse a diversity of oxygenation reactions in a large number of metabolic pathways in animals, plants and micro-organisms. This review discusses recent advances in the biochemistry and molecular biology of dioxygenases occurring in different biological systems. Â© 1994.
