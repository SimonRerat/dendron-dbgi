Today I tried to put some order on the old stuff. Here is a question: I have the same plant labelled with 2 dbgi codes, which one is the good one?
- oscularia deltoides: dbgi_000039 and dbgi_000123. On iNaturalist: dbgi_000123
- ephedra helvetica: dbgi_000117 and dbgi_000036. On iNaturalist: dbgi_000036
- Echeveria elegans: dbgi_000037 and dbgi_000124. On iNaturalist: dbgi_000124
- Leonurus cardiaca: dbgi_000038 and dbgi_000125. On iNaturalist: dbgi_000125
