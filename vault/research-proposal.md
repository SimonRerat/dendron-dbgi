A research proposal should be written in order to briefly but clearly present the DBGI to potential collaborators and funders.
The idea is to draft a 4-5 page proposal taht could eventually be published at RIO



# Notes

- Make a list of botanical gardens of Switzerland
@manu


- What is the total number of different species in Swiss botanical gardens ?
This should be answered. Get in touch with the guy in charge of the relational DB of species in Switzerland. Ask @manu or Alain
