EMI:

The goal of the Earth Metabolome Initiatve (EMI) is, like the Earth Biogenome Project, quite simple, yet ambitious: Document all of the chemical diversity (chimiodiversity) of all known living organisms, while anthropogenic biodiversity loss is speeding up.
In term, this should benefit  human society as a whole, help better understand the chemical fundations of the biosphere, and provide molecular arguments in favor of the protection of biodiversity.

It strives for the creation of a new web of knowledge, linking metabolomics, biology, chemistry, and other open datasets together.
To reach this goal, the EMI team will have to develop  informatical, organisational, and scientific tools tailor made for their needs.
This is where the Digital Botanical Gardens Initiative (DBGI) comes into place.


DBGI:

The Digital Botanical Gardens Initiative (DBGI) is designed as a pilot for the EMI. It has a central role to play in it as it is a pilot project created to design, automate, and optimize the workflow leading to metabolomic analysis, while having acces to a species rich, easily accessible, "controlled" environment (i.e. botanical gardens).

Its main goal is the collection, management, and sharing of digital informations acquired in living botanical collections. To do so, it focuses on large scale characterisation of the chemiodiverstiy of plants through mass spectrometric approaches (why this choice?).
Not to forget the creation of a knowledge graphe by recouping the informations from many databases (such as Botalista, Open tree of life, LOTUS, ...) to organise, structure and connect them all.
This should help visualise and search the functioning of ecosystems, orient research and conservation efforts.
As the methods of the DBGI while be applied to the EMI, its methods and workflow need to be scalable to match the scale of such an ambitious project. And ultimately, be applicable in wild, hard to access ecosystems.

As of now, only the Jardin Botanique de l'Université de Fribourg (JBUF) and the Jardin Botanique de Neuchâtel (JBN) are part of the initiative. The causes being practical reasons, founding teams have their offices located in Fribourg and Neuchâtel respectively, and ther unique characteristics, the JBUF arranged its angyosperms in a systematic way, and the JBN has a collection of ethnomedicinal plants.
