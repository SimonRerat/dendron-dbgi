## Today I learned that
I was looking for a way to format the [`html!` macro used in Yew](https://yew.rs/docs/en/next/html/index.html) in a more readable way. I found that the `html!` macro is a bit hard to read when the HTML is complex. The macro can be formatted by using the Visual Studio code extension `https://github.com/ttax00/code-yew-server`. This extension allows you to format the `html!` macro in a more readable way, among several other Yew-related features.
