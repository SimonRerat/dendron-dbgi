## The DOK trial
In the 1970s, discussions on food production in relation to the environment and yield had already been generating debate for several decades. Some pioneers of organic farming practice and scientific from the Research Institute of Organic Agriculture (FiBL) and from the Swiss federal research centre for agricultural chemistry and environmental hygiene founded the DOK trial in 1978. 

The DOK trial is a long terme experiment comparing three cropping systems. DOK stands for BioDynamic, bioOrganic and Konventionell. These three farming system have been studied for 45 years. Since the start of the trial, a large number of scientific publications have been produced thanks to this long-term experiment. Important topics such as climate adaptation, biodiversity, soil quality and yield have been studied on this site.
