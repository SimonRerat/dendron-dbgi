# Abstract 

# Background 

Here is the background of the thesis 

## Earth metabolome initiative 
The Earth Metabolom Initivative (EMI) is a large scale open science project whose aime is to catalogue the metabolome of all organisms currently known on the planet Earth. Ultimaly, this will create a library accessible to all, enabling targeted research and protection of certain organisms and metabolomites. These data will enable us to observe the chemodiversity of specific locations and thus add chemical arguments to environmental protection.

This initiative have three main objectif. The first one is to protect biodiversity by creating new argument based on the metabolome of the species. This will develope some molecular argument conservation and new vision of biodiversity trought new concepts such as "chemical endemisms", in other words molecule that are present only in a certain ecosystem. The second point is to understand the chemical fonctionnement of the biosphere. 

-->> finish this part 

 by establishing a global molecular map of the Earth metabolome  

## Digital botanical gardens initiative 
### Background 
The digital botanical garden Initiative (DBGI) is an EMI pilot project whose aim is to extract, catalogue, analyze and create a digital library of metabolomic data from plants found in botanical gardens. This enables the methods to be tested and the bioinformatics resources needed for data processing to be created.

Why choose the botanical gardens for this pilot project? Botanical gardens, although human-made, are hotspots of biodiversity and the ideal place to test collection, extraction and analysis methods. They display a considerable number of plants in a small, accessible area near to university and laboratories supplies. Botanical gardens provide an initial approach and the methods needed to eventually collect different organisms from wild ecosystems (see Earth Metabolome Initiative). Their biodiversity also makes it possible to set up a library of chemical extracts, enabling the development of the IT tools needed to analyze these data. 

Fribourg is privileged to have a university botanical garden where over 5,000 species are cultivated and conserved. This represents one of the largest systemic collections in Switzerland. The botanical garden and its research group play an active role in the conservation of rare and endangered species at cantonal and national level. At this point, around 2400 plants have already been collected, 1500 have been extracted and 1300 habe been profiled with liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. 

### Tropical greenhouse 
The tropical greenhouse (number 1 on the map) was sampled during my bachelor work. This greenhouse features decorative green plants, climbers, epiphytes and aquatic plants, all of which come from the rainforest. In all, some 280 plants are present with no specific taxonomic or provenance links.

#### DBGI Methodology
##### Collection 
To collecte plants in this greenhouse the DBGI methodology was applied. The collection method consists of cutting one or several leaves (depending on the size), wrap them in a coffee filter and put them in a falcon tube with a perforated cap. Each falcon tube is pre-labelled with a unique code assigned to the extract and use as an identifer throughout the experiments. The tube are then store in liquid nitrogen and finally put in the freezer (-80°C) if they are not freeze-dried immediatly. Each collected plant, will be report as a point on a qfield map, with several additional data such as the precise locatation, identification of the plant if possible and minimum five photos. These photos show : 
- 1) The plant identification pannel 
- 2) The plant identification pannel with the labelled falcon tube 
- 3) A general photo of the plant 
- 4) A detail photo of the plant 
- 5) The cutting area with the scalpel 
- 6) An additional photo can be taken if necessary

##### Extraction 
All plant extracts are freeze-dried and store in falcon tube with non perforated cap and store in a labelled container.

The first step of the precessus is to weigh out 50 micrograms of each extract and place it in an eppendorf 2ml with rounded bottom. We accepted an 5% of the weight as an error (±2.5 micrograms). Then add thee metal beads (4mm) inside the tube which will be used to crush the extracts. The plant remains are returned to the falcon and stored in the container.

![](/assets/images/2024-06-11-14-51-46.png)*Dry plant ready to be weighed*

The sample are then passed in the Retsch machine (shaker) for 2.5 minutes at 25Hz. In this process, the plants are ground to a fine powder.

![](/assets/images/2024-06-11-14-42-41.png)*Eppendoft tubes with grounded plants*

Once the plants have been ground, the tubes are carefully reopened and 1.7 ml of the extraction solution is pipetted into each tube. The extraction solution mix is composed of 80% methanol, 20% distilled water and 0.1% formic acid. The tubes are then returned to the Restch machine to be shaken again for 2.5 minutes at 25Hz.They are then centrifuged for 2 minutes at 13'000RPM to separate the supernatant from the plant deposits.

Finally, the supernatant is collected and pipetted into a vials tube with hermetically sealed caps. Approximately 1.4 ml of supernatant can be recovered. These tubes are then stored in a labelled container at -80°C.

![](/assets/images/2024-06-11-14-48-01.png)*Vials tube containing extracts of various plants from the tropical greenhouse*

##### Analysis 
120 microlitres of plant extracts are taken from the vials to form aliquots into new vials containing an insert. Those new vials are closed with a sliped cap. These aliquots are analyzed by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Spectra are then analyzed using bioinformatics tools.

![](/assets/images/2024-06-11-14-55-09.png)*Aliquots ready for the mass spectrometry*

#### Inaturalist ressources 
All photos taken at the time of collection are then upload on iNaturalist platform. This help us to check the identification of the plant by external experts and enables us to correct our identifications if necessary. It also benefits iNaturalist, as some plants not included in the database have been added by our request 

Here a link to the list of the plants collected in the tropical greenhouse https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?nelat=46.793262993305206&nelng=7.155081027961212&place_id=any&swlat=46.79316199515332&swlng=7.154816830373245&user_id=dbgi&verifiable=any 

#### Sample tracking 
Because of the large number of samples, it is important to have reliable sample tracking. As said before, as soon as the samples are collected, each plant is assigned a unique code. This code will follow the plant through each stage of extraction, analysis and storage. This unique code will be report on each different tube during the extraction process and all data relating to this sample are added to the database. By consulting this database, we can quickly find out which plant has already been extracted, how many times it has been extracted, the exact weight that have been extracted and in which container the various tubes are stored. The whole process is automated, and the database automatically updated.

# Transitioning from DBGI to EMI

## Background 
### The problematic

### The DOK trial
#### Historical background
In the 1970s, discussions on food production in relation to the environment and yield had already been generating debate for several decades. Some pioneers of organic farming practice and scientific from the Research Institute of Organic Agriculture (FiBL) and from the Swiss federal research centre for agricultural chemistry and environmental hygiene founded the DOK trial in 1978.

The DOK trial is a long terme experiment comparing three cropping systems. DOK stands for BioDynamic, bioOrganic and Konventionell. These three farming system have been studied for 45 years. Since the start of the trial, a large number of scientific publications have been produced thanks to this long-term experiment. Important topics such as climate adaptation, biodiversity, soil quality and yield have been studied on this site.

#### The site 
The DOK site is located in the canton of Baselland, halfway between Biel-Benken and Therwil. The area is located in the Rhine Valley. The floor of this Valley are filled with a layer of gravel and covered by loess material (fine Calcareous silt). This large layer of1 to 1.3 m deep created a fertile soil, that allows water to rise through capillary transport during the sommer. The climate is favorable for agriculture, with temperatures averaging 9.7° C until the end of the last century and current annual rainfall of 872 mm. However, average temperatures have been rising steadily in recent decades, with an average of 11.2°C between 2010 and 2020. Climate change and crop resilience are also being studied at DOK, with a view to future extreme weather events (drought, heavy rain, hail, etc.). 

#### Experimental design 


#### Previously obtained results

## DOK project experiments 
### Global experimental design 

### Collection review
The collection took place on April 18 from 1:30 p.m. to around 7 p.m. at the DOK trial (Localisation : 47.502578, 7.539575 (Therwil, Basel canton)). The collection went smoothly, with cool weather. It didn't rain in the afternoon, but conditions were damp because it had rained that very morning. We didn't find many insects on site, probably because the weather was too cold for them, but we did collect a few, along with slugs and soil macrofauna. All the wheat fields (with no difference between cropping systems) had been infected by a fungal disease, which may have an influence on the metabolomic results. 


### Collection methodology 

Equipment list for one afternoon collection

- Scissors 
- Sharp knife
- Soil corer

We carried out 4 experiments on the site, with the aim of testing different collection and analysis methods. 

### 20x20 crushed : chemodiversity  
#### Experimental concept 
We randomly select a 20cm x 20cm square in the plot, if possible avoiding edge effects. We cut everything in this square above ground level. The cultivated plant as well as any weeds growing in between and possibly insects, invertebrate or mushroom that were present in the area. All this samples are store in a ziplock with an unique code. They will then be extracted as one entities to rate and qualifie the chimiodiversity of the parcelle. 
#### Methodology 
We applied the methodology once in each of the 8 plots. Each type of agricuture is replicated four times on the DOK trial. That is allowing us to have four replications  of above-ground-biodynamic specimens and four replication of above-ground-conventional specimens. 

##### Collection
The 20cm X 20cm square is draw on the ground using a measuring tape. The location is randomly chose in on of the side row of the plot (the middle row is reserved for measuring yield and cannot be touched). All the crops, weeds and others wich are found in this square are cut at their base and put in zip-lock prelabbeled with an unique code stick on the inside, as it falls off easily when exposed to the cold. The entire zip-lock is then immersed in liquid nitrogen. The sample are store at -80°C waiting for the extraction process. 

During the collecte the zip-lock partially destroyed in liquid nitrogen. afterfurther test we dicide that paper bag should be use for the liquide nitrogen and the dry-freezer for the next collect. But zip lock are indispensable after the lyophilisation to keep the sample dry. 

##### Extraction 
The entire contents of the zip-lock are transfered to a paper bag and put in the dry-freezer for 72 hours. If necessary, additional time in the dry-freezer should be applied as the samples must be very dry. 

After lyophilization all the sample are weighted. They are then placed in a blender with a proportional amount of 200ml/40g of the dbgi extraction mix. The plants are blended until a homogeneous fluid is obtained. Six grams of this fluid are set appart in a falcon tube and 34 milliter of the dbgi mix are added to reconstituate the ratio of dbgi extraction. A second tube is completely filled with plant extract and stored at -80°C for future extractions.

Alternately the sample can be dry crushed in the blender and store as a dry powder. The dbgi mix can be add to the powder in the right proportion. This is the preferred option, as it is much faster. But can only be applied to completely dry samples. 

1700 microliters are then taken and placed in an eppendorf tube. The ependorf tube are centrifuged. The supernatant is reserve in a vial tube and further extraction and analysis is carried out as described in the dbgi methodology.

 Analysis of the statistical data and spectra is still in progress.  

### Mesofauna and Macrofauna extraction 
#### Experimental concept 
Compare the mesofauna of the soil between the conventional and the biodynamic agriculture. We decide to use the berlese extractor to collecte the mesofauna. We want to extract the metabolite of the entire sample without sorting the invertebrate and use this to rate and qualifie the chimiodiversity of the soil mesofauna. The megafauna (earthworm, centipede, spiders...) is sorted out before the berlese extraction and analyzed as individual extracts. 

The experiment is replicated four times for each type of agriculture systems. The soil block is collected in a random place in the plot (avoiding the center line, which cannot be touched). 

#### Methodology 
##### Collection 
A place is randomly chose in the side row of the 5m x 20m plot. To limit the crop damage, we took the soil sample right under the 20cm x 20cm cut for the previous method. A bloc of soil of 10cm x 10cm and 5cm deep is collected using a flat shovel and store in a zip-lock prelabelled with an unique code stick on the inside. The block is collected in such a way as to maintain the integrity of the soil structure as much as possible.  The soil blocks are store in a shaded area until the end of the collection process. They are then store in the 4°C fridge to await the extraction.
##### Berlese Extraction 
First of all, the block of earth is gently disassembled by hand. The megafauna is set aside. Each individual is placed in a pre-labelled falcon tube and an individual observation is added to qfield (located where the soil was taken). The observation is done exactly the same as the observation of plants. Photos are taken, localisation, and, if known, the species name (If not, "unknow" will be filled in the box).

The megafauna falcon tubes are store in the -80°C and then dry-freezed during 72 hours. Those specimens will then be extracted with the dbgi process.

The mesofauna is extracted by the berlese extractor. The soil is placed in a sieve and gently compacted. The sieve is placed over a funnel and a container of ethanol is placed directly underneath. A bulb that heats up is placed above the earth and this heat dries the soil from above. The mesofauna try to escape the heat and drought by escaping from below, eventually falling into the ethanol.

##### Extraction (after Berlese)
Photos of the mesofauna are done to futur identification of the specimens with the binocular loup. Then the falcon tube are centrifuged for 5 min at 5000 rps. The pellet is removed using a pipette with a cut tip and conserve in a eppendorf tube already weighted. If necessary, centrifuge the eppendorf tube for 2 min at 13'000 rps, take out the nupernatant and put the end of the pellet (if too much for). Remove the supernatant in the eppendorft tube, after centrifugation (2 min at 13'000 rps) and dry the extract with sample concentrator machine. 

Once dry, the eppendorft tube are weighted again and the mass of the specimens is add to the database. Then, a metal bead is placed on the tube and the further extraction process is done as dbgi extraction process. 

Additionally 1700 microliter of the ethanol of each sample is collected and put in a vial tube to see if any molecule have been extracted during the berlese processus. 
#### Result 
##### Emi_id of the sample and directus link (lab extract)
This experiment groups samples with the following identity:

- fibl_000083 : http://directus.dbgi.org/admin/content/Lab_Extracts/fibl_000083_02
- fibl_000085 : http://directus.dbgi.org/admin/content/Lab_Extracts/fibl_000085_02

- fibl_000097 : http://directus.dbgi.org/admin/content/Lab_Extracts/fibl_000097_02 

The link to directus are only available with a directus account and using the vpn of the University of Fribourg. 

 Analysis of the statistical data and spectra is still in progress. The data from these analyses will probably be irrelevant, as many of the samples were lost during the various laboratory stages. Part of the mesofauna dried inside the funnel during the Berlese extraction. Some of the samples were blown out of the tubes during drying with the sample concentrator.

### Plants pair comparison 
#### Experimental concept 
Found some plants that are present in the biodynamic plot and the conventional mineral one and compare their metabolomic content. 

#### Methodology
The first step is to make a brief tour of the fields and a list of the species present in the two plots (also list unknown species). For this experiment, we found three species present in both cropping systems: 

- The main crop: _Triticum aestivum_ of the Montalbano variety 
- The remains of last year's crop: _Solanum tuberosum_
- A species of poaceae

##### Collection and extraction
Collections and extractions are carried out using the same methodology as for the DBGI.

### Soil extraction 
#### Experimental concept 
Collection of soil from all plots and analysis of its metabolomic content. The soil is sampled using a small core. 

#### Methodology 
##### Collection and extraction 
Soil is taken at random from each of the 8 plots (4 replications of each cropping system). To limit damage to the field, we sample the soil in the same place as the soil block was sampled for the Berlese extraction. The soil core is then placed in a caffeine filter and immersed in liquid nitrogen. Further extraction is carried out using the DBGI metholodogy. 

#### Result 
##### Emi_id of the sample and directus link (lab extract)
