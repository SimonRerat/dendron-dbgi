## Abstract

Extracts obtained by rinsing the thorax and extracts from the tergal sex pheromone gland of females of the bagworm moth, Megalophanes viciella, as well as headspace samples from live animals, were analyzed to reveal the chemical structure of the pheromone. As a result, 1-methylethyl octanoae was established as a main sex pheromone component of this species. This was further confirmed by numerous caches of conspecific males in traps baited with this compound in Bulgaria and Roumania.
