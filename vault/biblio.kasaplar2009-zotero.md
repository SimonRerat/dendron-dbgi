## Abstract

(R)-Goniothalamin, is a member of styryl lactones, possesses selective cytotoxicity against cancer cell lines. In this work, replacement of styryl substituent with 2-naphthyl and 3-quinoyl gave new analogues which may have less conformational changes compared to the lead compound. Anti-proliferative tests indicated that 2-naphthyl substituted (R)-5,6-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-one has slightly better cytotoxicity than (R)-goniothalamin. To clarify the effect of 2-naphthyl substituent additional aryl substituted (R)-5,6-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-ones have been synthesized enantioselectively and tested against PC-3 and MCF-7 cell lines.
