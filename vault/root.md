# Overview

The Digital Botanical Gardens Initiative (DBGI, www.dbgi.org) ambitions to explore innovative solutions for the collection, management and sharing of digital information acquired on living botanical collections. A particular focus will be placed on the large scale characterization of the chemodiversity of living plants collections through mass spectrometric approaches. The acquired data will be structured, organized and connected with relevant metadata through semantic web technology. The gathered knowledge will then inform ecosystem functioning research and orient biodiversity conservation projects. The DBGI initially aims to take advantage of the readily available living collections of Swiss botanical gardens to establish robust and scalable biodiversity digitisation workflows. The ultimate goal is to apply these approaches in the field and at the global scale in wildlife ecosystems. 

# Main goals

The DBGI main goals are briefly summarized below :

# An Open Science project


## Working with the garage door up

A way of working briefly described by Andy Matuschak here https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu. 


## Open Notebook Science

If we apply this "working with the garage door up" idea to a scientific research endeavor we understand it as respecting the core concepts of open-science. These are in fact the principles of Open Notebook Science https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-notebook_science

For the projects of the DBGI we will follow such approach in order to share early ideas and results but also the less shiny parts of the research projects. 

You can follow the DBGI related Open Notebooks here [[open-notebook]].

Expect to find strange ideas, badly formulated text and poorly written code. However if you have time and interest you should be able to participate at each step of the process. Hopefully this will lead to enhanced collaboration and participation. Maybe yes, maybe not. Let's make it a methodological experiment !
