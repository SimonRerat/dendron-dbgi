## Welcome to the digitized botanical gardens initiative website

Here you can find a pilot project that aim to digitize the Fribourg botanical garden with liquid chromatography extractions and mass spectrometry analyses. The goal of this pilot is to find an easy, normalized way to collect and analyse plants in different environments, to permit a project further deployed at a national, whether international scale. With these ambitions, the project will be achieved in open science, to provide an easy access to anyone who wants to take part of it.

## The open science project

The open science describes a working method in science that share the entire research process and data to the relevant actors (Academia, Industry, Public authorities, citizen groups, ...). The goal is to diffuse the latest knowladges and improve the participation, the innovation process, the creativity and the trust in science (EC, 2022). 


## The pilot presentation

This pilot aim to try different extraction methods, species and plant parts to elaborate a simple way to create a national, whether international metabolomic platform. It will be based on 96 samples that corresponds to a 96 well plate for mass spectrometry to have a sufficient sample pool to determine the best exctraction method and begin with some random species available in the Fribourg botanical garden.

## The methodology

The 96 plate will be partly filled with the same specimen extracted with different liquid chromatography methods to seclect the best extraction way. Anotther part will host different parts of the same plant to determine the chemistry differences between them. For instance, it is not clear if we will analyse these different parts separately or alltogether in the same well.
