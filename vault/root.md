# Welcome to the digitized botanical gardens initiative website

Here you can find a pilote project that aim to digitize the Fribourg botanical garden with liquid chromatography extractions and mass spectrometry analyses. The goal of this pilote is to find an easy, normalized way to collect and analyse plants in different environments, to permit an open science project further deployed at a national, whether international scale.

With these ambitions, the project will be achieved in open science, to provide an easy access to anyone who wants to take part of it.

## The open science project

The open science describes a working method in science that share the entire research process to the relevant actors. The goal is to diffuse the latest knowladges and improve the participation, the innovation process, the creativity and the trust in science (EC, 2022).
