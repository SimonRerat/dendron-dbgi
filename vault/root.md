## Welcome to the digitized botanical gardens initiative website

Here you can find a pilot project that aim to digitize the Fribourg botanical garden with liquid chromatography extractions and mass spectrometry analyses. The goal of this pilot is to find an easy, normalized way to collect and analyse plants in different environments, to permit a project of untargeted large-scale plant metabolomic library further deployed at a national, whether international scale with a complete taxonomy based on the "Open Tree of Life" one. With these ambitions, the project will be achieved in open science, to provide an easy access to anyone who wants to take part of it.

## An open science project

The open science describes a working method in science that share the entire research process and data to the relevant actors (Academia, Industry, Public authorities, citizen groups, ...). The goal is to diffuse the latest knowladges and improve the participation, the innovation process, the creativity and the trust in science ([[biblio._]]).

## The pilot presentation

This pilot aim to try different extraction methods, species and plant parts to elaborate a simple way to create a national, whether international metabolomic platform based on the mass spectromety. It will be based on 96 samples that corresponds to a 96 well plate for mass spectrometry to have a sufficient sample pool to determine the best exctraction method and begin with some random species available in the Fribourg botanical garden. All plants will be classified following the Open Tree of Life taxonomy ([[biblio.opentreeoflife_2019]], [[biblio.opentreeoflife_2019a]]).
