# Overview

The Digital Botanical Gardens Initiative (DBGI) ambitions to explore innovative solutions for the collection, management and sharing of digital information acquired on living botanical collections. A particular focus will be placed on the large scale characterization of the chemodiversity of living plants collections through mass spectrometric approaches. The acquired data will be structured, organized and connected with relevant metadata through semantic web technology. The gathered knowledge will then inform ecosystem functioning research and orient biodiversity conservation projects. The DBGI initially aims to take advantage of the readily available living collections of Swiss botanical gardens to establish robust and scalable biodiversity digitisation workflows. The ultimate goal is to apply these approaches in the field and at the global scale in wildlife ecosystems. 

# Main goals

The DBGI main goals are briefly summarized below :

# An Open Science project

The open science describes a working method in science that share the entire research process and data to the relevant actors (Academia, Industry, Public authorities, citizen groups, ...). The goal is to diffuse the latest knowledge and improve the participation, the innovation process, the creativity and the trust in science ([[biblio._]]).
