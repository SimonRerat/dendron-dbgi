This Bachelor project is the first pilot of the Digital Botanical Gardens Initiative. It had for objective to test different processes to further select the final protocol for the main [DBGI project](https://www.dbgi.org/dendron-dbgi/).

More precisely, we have established and tested a sampling method, a location technic and a manner to link a maximum of informations about the plants to their samples. Moreover, we have tested two different sampling and storing technics (silica gel *vs* liquid Nitrogen) to compare their molecular conservation. Of course, the different processes cited and explained in this work will not necessary be used in the main project, and could change over time.
