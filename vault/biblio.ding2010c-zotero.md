## Abstract

Density functional theory/B3LYP has been employed to optimize the conformations of selected 4-arylflavan-3-ols and their phenolic methyl ether 3-O-acetates. The electronic circular dichroism spectra of the major conformers have been calculated using time-dependent density functional theory to validate the empirical aromatic quadrant rule applied to the assignment of the absolute configuration of this class of compounds. The modest 6-3IG basis set was sufficient to produce reasonable spectra. The calculated Cotton effects at 220-240 nm. crucial for the assignment of the C-4 absolute configuration, result from electronic transitions of the molecular orbitais involving the π-electrons of the spatially close aromatic A-ring and 4-aryl moieties. The sign of this Cotton effect is determined by the orientation of the 4-aryl substituent; the negative and positive Cotton effects are associated with 4α- and 4ß-ary1 substituents, respectively. © 2010 American Chemical Society and American Society of Pharmacognosy.
