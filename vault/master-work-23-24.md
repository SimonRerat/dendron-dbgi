This project aims to build a fully functional workflow from the specimen the the mass spectrometer. This implies to maximize automated pipelines in order to minimize the human errors and to merge work of multiple peoples. This complete workflow is fully explained in the Methods part. 

## Methods
The methods are organized in four categories, following the chronological order of the workflow.

### Database
The database is the main part that stores the data from the beginning to the end and to retrieve metadata to build the molecular network.

The installation is a postgresql database, with directus as the upper layer to make the connection between postgresql and the end user.

### Collection process
The collection process is made using QGIS and QField, with a QFieldCloud server.

### Lab process
